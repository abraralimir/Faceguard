# FaceGuard: Digital Identity Fortress

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

FaceGuard is a next-generation security tool designed to protect your digital identity. It provides a multi-layered defense system for your images and videos, making them resistant to unauthorized AI analysis, manipulation, and facial recognition while enhancing their quality for human viewers.

## Key Features

- **Image Enhancement & Upscaling**: Before protection is applied, your images are automatically enhanced. We use high-quality resampling algorithms to increase resolution and apply gentle sharpening, resulting in a clearer, higher-quality photo.

- **Multi-Layered AI Shield**: We apply a sophisticated, imperceptible shield to your images. This shield combines subtle noise, chromatic shifts, and micro-distortions that are invisible to the human eye but effectively "poison" the data for AI models, corrupting their ability to learn from or identify faces.

- **Invisible Watermarking**: A robust, invisible watermark is embedded directly into the image's pixel data using advanced steganography. This watermark contains a cryptographic signature that proves the image has been protected by FaceGuard.

- **Cryptographic Receipt**: For every protected image, you receive a unique, unforgeable digital receipt (a SHA-256 hash) signed with our server's private key. This provides undeniable proof of the image's protected state at a specific point in time.

- **Video Fingerprinting & Registry**: Videos are not altered. Instead, we compute a unique SHA-256 hash (a digital fingerprint) of the original file. This allows you to register your video's authenticity, providing definitive proof of the original content against any future deepfakes or manipulations.

## Our Philosophy: Privacy First

Your privacy is paramount. **All processing is done in-memory on the server.** Your original images and videos are never stored, logged, or saved. The protection is applied, the result is sent back to you, and the source data vanishes forever.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js (App Router)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS & ShadCN UI
- **Image Processing**: Sharp
- **Cryptography**: Node.js Crypto & Forge.js
